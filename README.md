# Structify

Too many college students fall victim to the trap of having too much free time, so we've built a custom schedule generator to fix that. First, input mandatory events, like classes, to form a base for your schedule. Then, add your hobbies, workouts, assignments, or anything else you want to do, and sit back as we automatically Structify your free time.
